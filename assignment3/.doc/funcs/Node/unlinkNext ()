/********************************************************************************
 * void unlinkNext ();;
 * 	Purpose: 
 * 		Un-links (does not delete) the next node in the list
 * 		Should really never be used unless splitting one list into two
 * 	
 * 	Entry: 
 * 		nothing
 * 	
 * 	Exit: 
 * 		next->prev is now 0 and this->next is now 0
 * 		next effectively becomes a new independent list
