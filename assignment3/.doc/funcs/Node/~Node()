/********************************************************************************
 * ~Node();;
 * 	Purpose: 
 * 		Destructor for node class
 * 		Doesn't really do anything but (currently) let you know
 * 		that the destructor was called
 * 		(for memory leak testing purposes
 * 		)
 * 	
 * 	Entry: 
 * 		A perfectly good node
 * 	
 * 	Exit: 
 * 		the exact same node except now nobody knows it exists
