/********************************************************************************
 * 	Purpose: 
 * 		Driver file for array-based CircularQueue and linked list-based
 * 		Queue classes.
 * 		Tests the ability of both to:
 * 		- pass integers through the queue, appending and popping 10 at a time
 * 		- throw appropriate exceptions for under/overflow conditions
 * 	
 * 	Input: 
 * 		Requires no input from user
 * 	
 * 	Output: 
 * 		You should see the exact same output twice.
 * 		The first one is the List-based regular queue and the second one
 * 		is the array-based circular queue.
 * 		
 * 		You should see:
 * 		- the numbers 0 through 99, space separated
 * 		- the following text:
 * 		Trying to underflow queue.
 * 		Caught underflow exception.
 * 		Trying to overflow queue.
 * 		Caught overflow exception
 * 		TODO: delete the period on the first underflow
 * 		That should be displayed twice when you run the program.
